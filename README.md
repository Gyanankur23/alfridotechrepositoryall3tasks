# Data Analysis, Cleaning, and Preprocessing Overview

This repository includes analysis, cleaning, and preprocessing for three datasets: **Superstore**, **E-commerce**, and **Traffic**. Below is the detailed description of the process performed for each task.

---

## 1. Superstore Dataset (`superstore.csv`)

### Libraries Used:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.

### Steps:
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Read the CSV file using `pandas`.
   - Inspected the structure and first few rows using `.head()`.

2. **Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicate rows with `drop_duplicates()`.
   - Filled missing values in categorical columns using `mode()` and in numerical columns using `median()`.
   - Standardized column names for consistency.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Converted date columns to datetime format using `pd.to_datetime()`.
   - Created new features, e.g., `Profit Ratio` using column arithmetic.
   - Categorized sales data into bins (`low`, `medium`, `high`) using `pd.cut()`.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generated statistical summaries using `.describe()`.
   - Plotted distribution of sales and profits using histograms and boxplots.
   - Created heatmaps to analyze correlation between numerical features.

## 2. E-commerce Dataset (`ecommerce.csv`)

### Libraries Used:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `scikit-learn` for encoding and scaling.
- `matplotlib` for visualization.

### Steps:
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.

2. **Cleaning**:
   - Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., session IDs).
   - Imputed missing values with `SimpleImputer` from `scikit-learn`.
   - Removed outliers using the `Interquartile Range (IQR)` method.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Used `LabelEncoder` for categorical features and `StandardScaler` for numerical scaling.
   - Performed one-hot encoding for multi-category columns.
   - Engineered new features, e.g., `Customer Value Index` combining purchase frequency and total spend.

4. **EDA**:
   - Created bar charts to visualize product categories and their popularity.
   - Analyzed customer behavior patterns using scatter plots.
   - Used pivot tables to summarize sales by region.

## 3. Traffic Dataset (`traffic.csv`)

### Libraries Used:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `numpy` for statistical computations.
- `plotly` for interactive visualization.

### Steps:
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported the CSV file and inspected the dimensions using `.shape()`.

2. **Cleaning**:
   - Detected and corrected invalid entries in `Speed` and `Volume` columns.
   - Filled missing weather conditions using forward-fill (`ffill`).
   - Removed rows with anomalous traffic volume using `z-score` thresholding.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Categorized time of day into `morning`, `afternoon`, `evening`, `night`.
   - Aggregated hourly data to daily summaries for trend analysis.
   - Normalized speed and volume data using `MinMaxScaler`.

4. **EDA**:
   - Visualized traffic patterns using line plots.
   - Analyzed seasonal trends with `groupby` on month and year.
   - Identified peak traffic times using histograms and time-series plots.
